version: 1.0.0+1

environment:
  sdk: ^3.9.0

dependencies:
  flutter_tts: ^4.2.0          # FIX: v3.x used v1 embedding; v4.x is fully v2-compatible
  camera: ^0.10.5+9
  permission_handler: ^11.3.0
  image_picker: ^1.2.1

  # FIX: speech_to_text 6.6.0 caused:
  #   SpeechToTextPlugin.kt — Unresolved reference 'Registrar', 'activity',
  #   'context', 'addRequestPermissionsResultListener', 'messenger'
  # Root cause: plugin still referenced the removed Flutter v1 embedding API.
  # Fix: upgrade to ^7.0.0 which was fully rewritten for Flutter v2 embedding.
  speech_to_text: ^7.0.0

  # FIX: vibration 1.9.0 caused:
  #   VibrationPlugin.java:20: error: cannot find symbol
  #   public static void registerWith(io.flutter.plugin.common.PluginRegistry.Registrar registrar)
  # Root cause: plugin still used PluginRegistry.Registrar which was removed in
  # Flutter v2 embedding. Fix: upgrade to ^2.0.0 which drops the v1 registerWith() method.
